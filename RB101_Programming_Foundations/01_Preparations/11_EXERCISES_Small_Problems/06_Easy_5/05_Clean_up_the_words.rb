=begin

Given a string that consists of some words and an assortment of non-alphabetic characters, write a method that returns that string with all of the non-alphabetic characters replaced by spaces. If one or more non-alphabetic characters occur in a row, you should only have one space in the result (the result should never have consecutive spaces).

Examples:

cleanup("---what's my +*& line?") == ' what s my line '

=end

def cleanup(str)
  str.tr("^A-Za-z", " ").squeeze
end

puts cleanup("---what's my +*& line?") == ' what s my line '
